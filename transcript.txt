I'm sorry, he's a little bit wound up. We had to stop at every maple candy stand on the way here. I ate all my gifts for everybody. 
SPEAKER 1 0:00:17
I'm sorry, Mr. Bing, there's no record of your reservation in the computer. 
SPEAKER 3 0:00:20
Well, that's impossible. Can you check again, please? Check again, please. 
SPEAKER 2 0:00:25
I'm sorry, it's not here. 
SPEAKER 1 0:00:27
Not there. 
SPEAKER 2 0:00:28
Let me get this straight. 
SPEAKER 3 0:00:30
I called yesterday to try to cancel my reservation, was told it's not refundable. Then we drove six hours all the way up here, and now you're telling me that we don't have a reservation? 
SPEAKER 1 0:00:38
I don't know what to say. Say the Lord is at. 
SPEAKER 2 0:00:42
I'm sorry.
